###### Suppose that the government imposes a  proportional income tax on the representative consumer's wage income. That, is the consumer's wage is $w(1-t)(h-l)$ where $t$ is the tax rate. What effect does the income tax have on wage income (as in question 3) given that either tax yields the same revenue for the government. You must use a diagram to show this. (Hint: The consumption bundle the consumer chooses under the proportional tax must be just affordable given the lump-sum tax).
